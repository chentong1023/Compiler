## Package

### Compiler
Only a main function.

### ====Semantic Stage====

### Parser

Generated by ANTLR4.8. 

Grammar description is in Mx_language.g4


### AST
Abstract Semantic Tree. Transport CST to a simpler form.

ASTBuilder extends from Mx_languageBaseVisitor.

### ExceptionS
There will be another two errors threw by the compiler.

`InternalErrorS` : If program runs error itself.

`SemanticError` : If your code has semantic error.

### Entity

Some sealed classes which represent the object that your program has claimed.
Deal with declaration of variable and its scope.

### FrontEnd

Here provides a abstract class that can visit the whole AST.

And we use it to do two things:

`SymbolTableChecker` : We use it to check every symbol is fit to the definition.

`Typecheck` : We use it to check whether the type of expression is compatible.

### Type

A class that represent the type of objects, such as int, bool, string...
